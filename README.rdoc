== RSS Cleaner

RSS Cleaner is a sinatra micro app created when I had a couple of RSS feeds from my hometown newspaper were not working correctly in feedly. I discovered that all I really needed to do was load them into ruby's RSS parser, and then spit them out again. That got rid of whatever problems were causing feedly to choke on them.

==== update
[Ohrenb√§r](http://ohrenbaer.de) also has a malformatted RSS feed, so I just this to clean it for my podcatcher.
